**Abstract:**

This product release, code-named "SurferLite," addresses three top requirements.  In order, they are [1] saving bandwidth or data usage to save money while browsing Internet (to be used for volume based Internet package), [2] download files with resume support which can’t be resumed after stop or pause, and [3] save all browser related settings and data on cloud.  All three are required for successful release and launch, which is planned for coming June.

In addition, a wide variety of other improvements and extensions have been identified.  None of these are defined as gating items for the release, so may be postponed if they threaten timeliness or functionality of the release.

**Competitive Strengths and Weaknesses:**

Some competitors are some proxy server capable of doing some of the things that our project trying to do but they are used with usual browser and don’t provide maximum optimization for free. They require money to work, but we are trying to save money by saving bandwidth so this is one of our competitive strength.

But since this project is just starting, we have to work very hard to compete with them to let believe user that switching from their usual browser is not hard and is beneficial for some time when you are in volume based Internet package.
