Hey guys/girls, talk about a delay!<br />
To be fair, I did finish <a title="Super OS 11.10" href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS_11.10">Super OS 11.10</a> back in October/November 2011, but&#8230; I&#8217;ve been having some health issues and I just kept delaying the release&#8230;<br />
Anyway, here it is.</p>
<p>New:<br />
*Improved multi-language support with additional translations and language-specific fonts<br />
*Improved Virtual Machine support (VirtualBox and VMware)<br />
*Added programs: Audacity, Blender, OpenShot, PiTiVi, MyPaint, Pinta, Inkscape, Pidgin, GIMP, Synaptic, VirtualBox, Thunderbird, Gdebi, OpenJDK<br />
*Removed: Java (replaced with OpenJDK)</p>
<p>All this and the ISOs are relatively small: 1.8 GB for 32-bit and 2 GB for 64-bit</p>
<p>More info and download: <a title="Super OS download" href="http://hacktolive.org/os">hacktolive.org/os</a></p>
<p>PS: Java was removed from the Ubuntu repositories (<a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html">blame Oracle</a>), so I included OpenJDK. I know some of you need the original Java to use some banking sites, etc&#8230; I will try to re-add the original Java client in Super OS 12.04.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all, as you might have guessed, I&#8217;m already preparing <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS">Super OS</a> 11.10&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t advance the final list of feature because that is still subject to change, but I can confirm several new apps will be added, it will have better internationalization/localization and better Virtual Machine support. Of course, as a consequence of this, the ISO will grow, but I can confirm the size will be between 1 GB and 4 GB and it will fit a regular/normal DVD.<br />
In addition to that, I will again make and release <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Ubuntu_extras_remix">Ubuntu extras remix</a>, so you still have a choice if you need a very light system.<br />
As always, the release date is uncertain, however, I expect to release Super OS 11.10 still in October, 2011.<br />
Ubuntu extras remix will be released after Super OS, possibly still this month.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently changed the structure of the <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS_repository">Super OS repository</a>: on the server-side it means all repositories (10.04, 10.10, 11.04, etc&#8230;) are now on the same folder, making it much easier to manage and wasting less space. In addition to that, the repository also has a more standard URL: <em>deb http://hacktolive.org/repo/archive DISTRO_CODENAME</em></p>
<p>How to make the transition to the new repository:<br />
-Users of <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS_11.04">Super OS 11.04</a>: you don&#8217;t need to do anything, the new repository is already included.<br />
-Users of <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS_10.04">Super OS 10.04</a> and <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS_10.10">Super OS 10.10</a>: you should see a new update called &#8220;super-os-repo&#8221; (version 0.4.004 or above) and simply need to install that.</p>
<p>If you are using an older version of Super OS, you are not sure if you already installed the new repository, or you had issues upgrading, use <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS_repository#Adding_the_repository">the official .deb installer</a> (<a href="http://hacktolive.org/download/super-os-repo-installer.deb">direct link here</a>).</p>
<p>There shouldn&#8217;t be any issues, but if they arise, feel free to <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Contact">report them</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally it is possible to download Super OS 11.04 using torrents.<br />
While it is true that in the initial hours after release the download is a bit slow, after the releases start spreading the downloads should be much faster than direct HTTP downloads from file-hosting websites (which limit the download bandwidth).<br />
The torrents are being seeded from a dedicated seebox, so there will be always seeds, but if you can also seed yourself, the download speeds will be higher for everybody.</p>
<p>Get them at the official page: <a href="http://hacktolive.org/os">http://hacktolive.org/os</a></p>
<p>Or just use these direct links:<br />
<a href="http://hacktolive.org/files/downloads/torrents/Super_OS_11.04_32_bits.torrent">http://hacktolive.org/files/downloads/torrents/Super_OS_11.04_32_bits.torrent</a><br />
<a href="http://hacktolive.org/files/downloads/torrents/Super_OS_11.04_64_bits.torrent">http://hacktolive.org/files/downloads/torrents/Super_OS_11.04_64_bits.torrent</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My real life got in the way of Super OS&#8230; I got sick, etc&#8230; I&#8217;m OK now, and back to work!</p>
<p>All known last-minute issues and bugs seems to have been fixed and Super OS 11.04 is nearly finished. All I have to do is to re-make the ISOs and test them&#8230; sounds easy&#8230; lets just hope no further issues arise&#8230;</p>
<p>I think (and hope) Super OS will be made and released still in this month, May&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Update </strong>(28th May 2011): Super OS 11.04 is already finished and is being uploaded, expect a release today (28th) or tomorrow (29th)</p>

<p>Hello all, just want to inform you that Super OS 11.04 is being prepared and most of the work is already done, it should be released in the next 7 days.<br />
Everything in Ubuntu 11.04 will be kept, including Unity, Dash, and all that. All behavior and appearance will remain like in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Besides the big changes introduced to Ubuntu, <a title="Super OS homepage" href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/Super_OS">Super OS</a> will have an improved local repository, with easy offline installation of drivers (nvidia, ati/amd, broadcom), which will now be even more useful, since many computers require additional drivers to make Unity work.</p>
<p>I also hope to include and improved version of a program I have been working on&#8230; lets see&#8230;</p>
<p>More news soon!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The news are a bit old, but it seems the WWF has introduced <a href="http://www.saveaswwf.com">a &#8220;new&#8221; format that &#8220;cannot be printed&#8221;.</a></p>
<p><strong>Well, lets look into the technical aspects of the format:</strong></p>
<p>-A .wwf file is in reality a .pdf file (with added restrictions)<br />
-The &#8220;no printing&#8221; restriction is a flag inside the PDF file, which means the document is still &#8220;open&#8221; and standards-based (as far as I can tell)<br />
-The DRM is implemented on the PDF reader, which chooses either to respect the  flag (and forbid printing), or simply ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>This is a bad idea on so many levels:</strong></p>
<p>-It prevents printing at all times, even when printing would be really important<br />
-What if someone has problems in the eyes and need to print lots of files, even trivial ones, just to be able to read them?<br />
-What if you have problems in your computer screen, making documents hard to read? (My old laptop has a this problem)<br />
-How about creating paper &#8220;backups&#8221; of documents?<br />
-How about the preservation of documents for the future, by having them on paper?<br />
-Computers use a lot of energy, are made with several dangerous chemicals and require lots of resources to produce them, do we really want to encourage the reading on PCs, as a REPLACEMENT of the good old paper? (yes, because with that DRM, you are forced to read those things on the PC)<br />
-etc, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>As an open-source supporter and a pseudo-historian interested in data preservation, I only have to conclude this format should be avoided and I have to oppose it, even if the intentions behind it are noble. In my opinion, the solution for the waste/pollution problem would first be education and secondly, why not also promote fonts/software that reduce ink usage? Or promote the usage of &#8220;save as PDF&#8221; as a way to have a easy-to-share file, instead of just printing to paper? Or even promote open-source systems (Linux or others) that give new life to old computers?</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/WWF_file_format">here is an easy way to break the DRM</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey people, we have another great bundle of games!</p>
<p><a href="http://hacktolive.org/wiki/File:Humble_Bundle_2.png"><img src="http://hacktolive.org/w/images/Humble_Bundle_2.png" alt="Humble Bundle 2" width="431" height="101" /></a></p>
<p>In case you are not familiar with the &#8220;humble bundle&#8221; concept, they simply let you pay whatever you want for a collection of games, even 1$ or even just a penny.</p>
<p>Games in this bundle:<br />
<em><strong><a href="http://www.braid-game.com">Braid</a><br />
<a href="http://www.cortexcommand.com"> Cortex Command</a><br />
<a href="http://machinarium.net"> Machinarium</a><br />
<a href="http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos">Osmos</a><br />
<a href="http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans"> Revenge of the Titans</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The games are DRM-free, are available for Windows/Mac/Linux and are fully usable offline (the only downside is really the lack of source-code).</p>
<p>On a personal note, I had already been interested in Machinarium, Osmos and Braid, so this was really a great way to grab those games in a legal and clean way, while at the same time contributing back to the developers. This time I even doubled my offer and gave away 20$.</p>
<p>Grab them here: <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com">www.humblebundle.com</a><br />
<strong>Hurry up!  This offer expires in about 24 hours!<br />
</strong></p>
